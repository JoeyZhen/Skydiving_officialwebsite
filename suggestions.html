      <h2>Before Skydiving</h2>
      <h3>WHAT TO BRING & WEAR</h3>
      <p class="word">For your tandem skydive please remember you must bring a valid form of ID 
        (driver's license or passport) and the credit card you paid with online. Wear comfortable, 
        athletic clothes and closed shoes like sneakers.</p>

      <h3 class="word">Suitting up</h3>
      <p class="word">Harness: Equipment worn by student around the legs and torso which attaches to the instructor 
        via four (4) points of attachment, two (2) on the shoulders, and two (2) on the hips. The skydive center has jumpsuits 
        designed to keep your clothes clean upon landing, and for hot days there are jump pants available. If you would like to 
        wear a suit or pants, your instructor can direct you to the appropriate size. With your pockets empty and shoes on tight, 
        your instructor or qualified staff member will help you into the harness. It may feel loose, this is on purpose for your 
        comfort, final tightening adjustments will be made while attaching to your instructor. Your goggles will be either attached 
        to the harness for later, or you may wear them around your neck. The instructor will tell you when to put the goggles on, 
        wearing them too early can cause them to fog up, so wait for the instructors que. Properly fitting the goggles to your face 
        is important to make the most of your experience. The key to proper fitting goggles is a good seal along the bottom edges, 
        around the cheeks and over the nose. To do this, you may need to lower the goggles until a good seal is achieved. Tighten 
        the goggles by pulling the knot of the strap by each temple. They should be very snug, but not uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <h3 class="word">Boarding the aircraft</h3> 
      <p class="word">It is important that you remain next to your instructor when crossing the fencing onto the active airport tarmac. 
        Our instructors will maintain positive control, meaning they will hold on to your harness while escorting you to the airplane. 
        In most cases, you will be boarding the plane while the engine is running and propeller is spinning. The propeller spins at a 
        rate which makes it almost invisible, so it is extremely important to stay behind the wings at all times. We approach the aircraft 
        from the rear, and your instructor will tell you where to sit.

      <h2>After Skydiving</h2>
      <h3 class="word">Landing</h3>
      <p class="word">Your instructor will be in control of the landing, and it is key that you do as directed promptly as seconds count. 
        Approximately 20 seconds before landing, the instructor will say something like ‚ÄúLEGS UP,‚Äù this is your que to raise your feet as 
        if you are sitting on the floor with your legs straight in front of you, there should be a slight bend in your knees, but you should 
        be able to see your toes. You may hold your legs up if necessary, and you should remain in this position until you are on the ground. 
        We plan on sliding every landing in on our butt, although the instructor may deem it prudent to land on your feet, should that be the 
        case, they will announce for you to stand up with them. ONLY STAND-UP IF YOU ARE TOLD TO DO SO, if you‚Äôre not sure, LEGS UP, it is easy 
        for the instructor to abort a stand-up landing and sit with you, but if you try to stand while the instructor is trying to sit, you run 
        the highest risk for injury.
