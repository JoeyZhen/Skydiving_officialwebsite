      <h2 class="word">WHAT IS SKYDIVING?</h2>
      <p class="word">"The United States Parachuting Association (USPA) defines skydiving - that original "extreme sport" that precipitated the term's
         emergence into the cultural lexicon - as follows:</p>
        <ol class="word">

        <li class="word">The descent of a person to the surface from an aircraft in flight when he or she uses or intends to use a parachute during all or part of that descent.</li>
        <li class="word">To jump from an aircraft with a parachute.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="word">
        "The key elements here are "aircraft" and "parachute." An "aircraft" has to be just that: a vehicle moving through the air. The aircraft doesn't have to be an airplane - it can be a hot-air balloon, a microlight, a paraglider with a tandem harness to jump from, or a big ol' dirigible. The "parachute" must be present, but it doesn't have to be of any particular kind. It can be an old-school round or a modern ram-air (square) number. These days, it's almost always the latter.

        Skydives are performed using a "two-parachute system," which comprises of a "container" (the backpack into which the fabric is folded) and two parachutes: the main canopy and the backup parachute (or "reserve") in case the main one malfunctions. In most skydiving systems, there's a device installed which opens the reserve parachute in the eventuality that the skydiver does not or is not able to open his/her own parachute unaided. These failsafes permit the stupendous statistical safety of tandem skydiving (which is heavily regulated)." (SKYDIVE LONG ISLAND April 6, 2018)</p>

          <h2 class="word">History of Skydiving</h2>
        <p class="word">
          "While the use of parachutes dates all the way back to 1100 in China, the activity we call "skydiving" can be most directly linked 
          to France in the late 18th century. Skydiving has come a long way from the beginning of parachuting, which dates all the way back 
          to 10th century China. The activity we know today is more closely related to what a man named Jacques Garnerin became famous for in 
          late 18th century France-Garnerin jumped from balloons with a parachute for show. This got the ball rolling for the popularization of 
          parachuting, and in the transition from balloons as base platforms to airplanes, American parachutist Tiny Broadwick was the first 
          woman to jump from a plane at the beginning of the 20th century." (SKYDIVE LONG ISLAND April 6, 2018)</p>
