        <h2>For this website...</h2> 
      <div class="fakeimg">
        <p class="word">Since all of the videos and pictures on the website belong to me and my cousins and I 
            get the permit from my cousins already, I just put five references on the reference page. 
            I hope that's enough. For the logo part, I create it by Photoshop. The color of the external frame is orange because orange 
            represents the bloom and courage of life. The color of the internal frame is blue because the sky 
            is blue and it's a symbol of freedom. In the center, I use capital letters to represent the company's name, 
            and the accompanying star pattern comes from a special font. For the CSS, I rollover two images to make people browsing 
            the page feel more vivid.
          </p>

            <p class="word">Be honest, I think my logo design and distribution of contents are good. Because according to the Photoshop skills 
              I learned, I independently completed a truly own product. This sense of accomplishment is unprecedented. And I follow the CRAP 
              principles to write content like the texts, the videos, and images. This is the result of my best efforts. At the same time, 
              I also added some post-credits scene on the websites. I hope you can find it. Also, I add the mobile and print style sheet
              to the CSS page. Although it's not that perfect, I try my best to make the website more beautiful. However, I think I havenâ€™t done enough in terms 
              of color matching. I always wanted to use all the colors on the web page, but I learned that this is the dazzling culprit for 
              readers later, rather than beautiful. I hope to learn more about after effect techniques in the future so that I can do better 
              or more vivid on web page design.</p>
              
          <p class="wordcenter">PS: I buy these videos and pictures with my life and I hope I can exchange the extra points with those videosðŸ˜€ !</p>
