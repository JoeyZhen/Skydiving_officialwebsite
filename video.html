      <h2>What happens when you merge with the sky?</h2>
      <h3 class="word">(1) Exiting the plane:</h3>
      <p class="word">A few minutes prior to opening the door, your instructor will connect
      your harness to his/her rig, and make any final adjustments. There will be a review of the exit procedure, which will 
      conclude with you putting on your  goggles and the door opening. Each instructor has their own unique style within the
      two main exit procedures, so it is important to listen and follow their instructions in a timely fashion. Below are foundations
      of the two exits from the aircraft, again, each instructor will have their own style, so listen and follow their directions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="facing"><u>Facing the tail:</u> You and your instructor will be sitting on the floor of the aircraft facing the tail. The instructor 
          will place their left foot outside on the step, and then tell you to do the same with both of your feet. Assume the safety 
          position, so you do not catch them on anything while exiting. Lift your chin and keep breathing, relax and go along with your 
          instructor. The goal for the exit is to not push back on the instructor, or pull the instructor out, it is to go along with them, 
          as if you are dancing and they are leading.</li>
          <li class="facing"><u>Facing forward:</u> You will kneel on the floor of the aircraft facing the instrument panel, the instructor will place their 
            right foot on the step outside, and direct you to do the same. Your left foot will remain in the aircraft until the exit is launched. 
            Lean over your right knee, staying low to give the instructor room in the door. Place your hands in the safety position. Lift your 
            chin and take a deep breath, relax and go along with your instructor. The goal for the exit is to not push back on the instructor, 
            or pull the instructor out, it is to go along with them, as if you are dancing and they are leading.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="word">(2) Freefall:</h3>
      <img class="middle" src="assets/images/position.png" alt="position" width="700" height="250" >
      <p class="word"> Once youâ€™ve exited the aircraft, you can expect a sense of disorientation, 
        but this will dissipate quickly as your instructor stabilizes the freefall. Your chin should be up, meaning your gaze should 
        be towards the horizon, versus down towards the ground. Your hands should still be in the Safety Position and you should bring 
        your feet together and back towards your butt. Legs and feet are used to orient the body in freefall, so curling your feet back 
        will give the instructor the most control. Pushing your hips forward will put you into an Arch Position 1 and will assist the instructor
         in maintaining stability. Once stable, the instructor will tap your shoulder, queuing you to let go of your harness and move your arms 
         into Arch Position 2. If you do not move your arms, you may feel the instructor pull on your forearm to signal you to let go. It is not 
         mandatory to let go of the harness, but recommended. During freefall it is important to not inhibit the instructors movements in any way, 
         especially his/her hands and arms. Do not put your arms on top of theirs, or trap their arms under your arms. Do not hold onto their arms 
         with your hands, the only thing you can hold is your harness. It is also important to not reach behind you. The instructorâ€™s rig has 
         handles to jettison the main parachute and deploy the reserve chute, these are located behind you, and although they are difficult to 
         reach, it is possible. For this reason, you should always keep your hands where you can see them. </p>

      <h3 class="word">(3) Parachute Flight:</h3>
      <p class="word">When your instructor opens the parachute, most people instinctively grab their harness, 
        this is advantageous as you may be instructed to go back into the Arch Position 1 in the case of jettisoning the main parachute. 
        If the parachute deployment is uneventful, you can relax your arms and legs and take a look around. The instructor will be adjusting 
        the hip attachment points to allow you more movement for landing. To assist your instructor, you may raise your knees and lower the leg 
        straps from the groin area, and position the straps like a swing, so you are in more of a seated position. During the parachute flight, 
        the instructor may ask if you would like to fly the parachute. It is not required that you do so, nor is it possible on every jump. 
        Should they offer, and you would like to fly, listen carefully to their instructions and do not maneuver the parachute without direction. </p>
