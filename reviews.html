        <p class="comment">This was my first tandem skydive and it was 
        the most exhilarating and breathtaking experience I've ever had in my life! I felt so free, alive, and full of bliss 
        in the air and I even had tears of joy during and after the skydive! The view was so beautiful from above and the breeze 
        felt so comforting! While I was waiting for my turn to skydive, it was interesting to watch other people's excitement 
        during and after their skydive. This got me smiling and even more excited! Also, the guys folding the parachutes were even 
        playing trip-hop music -- this added to my experience because I LOVE trip-hop! The staff overall was super chill and fun to 
        converse with, especially Heather! I love how most of them were optimistic and I got the impression that they all love their 
        jobs. My instructor was Didi and he was awesome to work with and took excellent photos and footage! Due to certain regulations,
        I waited longer than I expected for my turn to skydive. However, I did my best to remain positive. I knew it would be worth the wait,
        and sure enough it was! Thank you Long Island Skydiving Center for such a unforgettable experience! I will definitely return one day!
        Peace and love!</p>

        <p class="comment">At first, it was scary but after I met my instructor and started the process he made me feel more comfortable and confident about the jump. I am very grateful to have done it and that Matt was my instructor that day, I hope he is there when I go back. More importantly, 
        I am giving this feedback because he kept me alive... Thanks to all of the team for the experience....</p>

        and my coach was great at putting me at ease on my first jump. Really enjoyed it and can't wait to join the next extreme sport!
